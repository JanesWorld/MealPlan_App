# About Meal Plan Application 
The purpose of this application is to allow busy people to cook a quick meal based on their health goals with just what they have in their fridge and cupboard. 
The app will evolve starting off with a basic version that will connect to an API that houses recipes and advance all the way to a full blown mobile application. The roadmap highlights which functionalities you should expect at each version. 

# Application Roadmap
There are multiple versions of this application 
v1 - Attempts to create the simple structure and attain the data from the API
v2 - Attempts to improve the styling of the application, this should inclue phone usage as well

# Future Versions

v4 - Will bring in user authentication, allow users to favourite meals, allow users to add ingredients they want to make to a 'Shopping List',

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
